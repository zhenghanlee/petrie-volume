# Petrie Volume
This repository houses the source code for algorithms related to our research on petrie-walks with its relation to convex volume computations.

## Features
- Computation of the volume of the convex hull of a set of points
- Verify whether a graph is a petrie-complete MPG (Not yet implemented)

## Getting Started (Cloning)
This set of instructions is for Mac users.
1. Install Git, refer to [Git - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for more information.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Change directory to a desired directory for the folder to be cloned.
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/zhenghanlee/petrie-volume`.

## How to Use
### Computation of Convex Volumes
1. Open Terminal.
2. Change directory to `petrie-volume` folder.
3. Run `javac convexVolume/volumeCalculator.java` to compile `volumeCalculator.java`.
4. Run `java convexVolume/volumeCalculator new` to start the calculator.
